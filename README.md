#### Hello there! ✌️

I am really interested in modern **development technologies**. I'm mostly developing in JVM environments using [Kotlin](www.kotlinlang.org) or [Java](www.oracle.com).  
As tech lead of a small group of persons I have to design software architecture, assure quality and rate/adjust the overall development pipeline.

What I'm **really interested** in:
- [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/), [native images](https://www.graalvm.org/docs/getting-started/#native-images), [polyglot](https://www.graalvm.org/docs/getting-started/#polyglot-capabilities-of-native-images)
- Development Infrastructures
- Quality Assurance (e.g. static code analysis, code quality)
- Scalability (deployment, load balancing, expandability, maintainability) of applications
